A high-performance **website load and stress testing tool** designed to evaluate how a web application behaves under heavy traffic.

This project helps developers and system administrators **test performance, stability, and scalability** of their own websites or services **with proper authorization**.

## Features

- High concurrency request simulation  
- Configurable request rate & duration  
- Supports HTTP/HTTPS targets  
- Real-time stats (requests, failures, latency)
- Lightweight & fast
- Ideal for:
  - Load testing
  - Stress testing
  - Benchmarking
  - Infrastructure scaling tests

## How It Works

The tool sends a controlled number of concurrent requests to a target URL to simulate real-world traffic spikes.  
This helps identify:

- Performance bottlenecks
- Server limits
- Response degradation
- Failure thresholds
